# TidepoolManualUploader

Scrappy attempt at minimum tidepool csv uploader, written in angular. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Gotchas

Tidepool client did not have types so I had to generate them. Will have to add and include that directory locally instead of from NPM
